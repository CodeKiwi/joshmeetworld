Laazy is live

Starting the project

The team

## The approach

There are three core components to Laazy. Pipelines, Splits and Actions, which work together to make it easier to get consistent results without having to fire up (or pay for) resource hungry graphics software.

Actions are single 'things' that you may want to do to an image. Be it setting aspect ratio, setting file or folder details, messing with meta data, resizing an image or something more clever like removing background colours or setting the 'focal point' of an image.

Splits are a special type of action that facilitates splitting the output of an image into multiple streams. The means a single image can become many different images with rules and treatments applied.

Pipelines are a collection of actions that make up a whole process, pipelines have a single input and one or more outputs, so once a pipeline has been set up all you need to do is upload or drag an image onto it. Laazy will do the rest.

The system is scalable and we can deploy increasingly complex and clever actions that can be dropped into pipelines - we have some cool ones in the pipleine ;) but I we are keen to hear what our users find useful.
