There is a trope that has been consistently rolled out at pretty much every tech conference for the last few years. That is that Data has eaten or is in the process of eating the world - it's not bullshit, but it's not working either.

This is (self aggrandizing) shorthand for "The methods of collection, scale and storage of data have long ago eclipsed the ability of our feeble brains to process it". The scale at which data is now collected, stored and made available means that we need more sophisticated tools than have previously been available. Machine Learning and it's more perplexing older brother Deep learning have delivered on this promise.

The things Machine Learning can do for us seems to be limitless (or so buzzefeed/HackerNews/Product hunt will have us believe). Every week there is the newest hottest startup with Machine Learning at it's core that will solve some perceived problem or other.

But there is a problem.

For years I have been a consumer of data driven services, happy to have my driving routes optimised, my NetFlix queue effortlessly entertaining, my Uber a comfortable chariot to whisk me to my destination and my AirBNB's to be a veritable palace to spend my leisure time. But as I said, I am a consumer, I dodn't contribute back as much as I know I should. There never seems to be time to submit that Trip Advisor rating, at the end of a NetFlix marathon I never remember to go back and thumbs up or thumbs down what I have just watched. Side note, WTF NetFlix? Whats with getting rid of the five point rating that actually made sense.

At the core of all these services is data (duh?). There are two main types of data Quantitative and Qualitative - Quantitative is quantified data, so think sensor data, measurements, timings, usage etc. So I guess Qualitative is qualified, this involves conscious thought and expressions, it requires asking users how they felt, how the overall experience was or how they would rate a service - and this is a little trickier, the former they have in spades, our phones and behaviour leaks data at every turn - but the later relies on us, it requires us to actually do something. They need to know what we   and over time I have noticed as drift in quality in the suggestions and services being provided. My Uber doesn't seem to be the 

Data fear


we want the products of data science but contribution has become something to become wary of


Beyond getting better recommendations 

I am committing to being a contributor. 

What I still won't do.
