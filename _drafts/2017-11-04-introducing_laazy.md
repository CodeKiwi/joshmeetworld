Seven months ago I started out on my Remote Year adventure, sure I had a yearning to see the world, to travel to exotic places and generally do amazing things with a group of crazy, wonderful individuals. That is all true (and accomplished) but my motives however were a little more complex - something I explained a little about in [my very first post](/musings/2017/01/here_we_go), now I can finally draw the covers back on what I have been working on.

TL;DR; With help from some of my fellow Kaizen's I am launching the private beta for Laazy - a product I am very excited about. [Go sign up for early free access](https://beta.laazy.io)

##Career crisis or perhaps just midlife

But a little bit of background first. Prior to RemoteYear I held a comfortable senior position at one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. I was good at this job and the company remunerated me adequately. The work was interesting but I never truely felt challenged.

Looking back on my career I had always reflexively switched from job to job, leaving one that I didn't like any more, only to pick up the most appealing one presented by recruiters before I started to bemoan the lack of incoming funds. I would stay just longer than was comfortable (usually about 2 years) and then repeat the process.

But that wasn't the biggest problem - and is not an uncommon pattern for developers. The problem was that I was always solving other people's problems, not even my employers problems, but my employers employers problems.

I have [built products and companies for myself in the past](/projects) and despite total success eluding me thus far it has been by far the most interesting and rewarding work I have done.

I wanted to get back to building something of value - it doesn't have to be the next Facebook but if I can solve a problem for a group of people then that is a start.

##The lightening bolt

The problem was that I didn't know what I wanted to build - building a product just for the sake of building something is a terrible idea. It was for this reason that I started this blog in the first place, a project to focus on until lightening struck. Fortunately for me (not so much for this blog) I didn't have to wait long.

Due to an itinerary change - I needed to travel to Serbia for a few days exploring before I was due to finally meeting up with the Kaizen's and start the adventure.

I started this blog a few months prior while adventuring around [New Zealand](/travel/antipodes/). I had managed to keep my publishing fairly regularly, I wanted from the start for posts to be visually engaging, each post had a hero image (top post image), this image needed to be resized into a number of different formats before I could publish the post.

* I needed a full size version, the size for the actual top of the post.
* a tiny thumbnail image for promoting the post on other pages.
* a medium sized version for promoting the post on the blog homepage and twitter.
* then finally I needed a square version cropped and resized for posting on instagram (I know instagram can do this but I prefer not to cede more control over to the social networks).

And that's just for the post header image, there were also the post inline images and homepage header images (which I like to change occasionally). Suffice to say this seemed like a lot of messing around for a single image.

I am not a designer but I have done a lot of design work in my career, I have a working knowledge of Photoshop and Sketch and whilst these tasks are not difficult by any stretch - I feel they are a waste of time. What made it worse was I stored all the requisite image dimensions in the digital equivalent of a postIT note. There has to be a better way.

##The idea

Now I had a problem to solve, the more I thought about it, the more I got excited. The number of potential applications a flexible approach could address kept on growing.

The list of potential users grew from bloggers to include social media power users, website content managers, software developers even photographers, designers and project managers (and much more that I won't reveal just yet). Pretty much anyone who ever has to prepare images for use in a distribution medium (online or otherwise).

There is no reasonable way to automate tedious repetitive image processing tasks for even basic actions.

So the idea for Laazy was born. Our mission is to make the lives of anyone who has to deal with images for love or money, just that little bit better. Be smart-laazy.

##The approach

There are three core components to Laazy. Pipelines, Splits and Actions, which work together to make it easier to get consistent results without having to fire up (or pay for) resource hungry graphics software.

Actions are single 'things' that you may want to do to an image. Be it setting aspect ratio, setting file or folder details, messing with meta data, resizing an image or something more clever like removing background colours or setting the 'focal point' of an image.

Splits are a special type of action that facilitates splitting the output of an image into multiple streams. The means a single image can become many different images with rules and treatments applied.

Pipelines are a collection of actions that make up a whole process, pipelines have a single input and one or more outputs, so once a pipeline has been set up all you need to do is upload or drag an image onto it. Laazy will do the rest.

The system is scalable and we can deploy increasingly complex and clever actions that can be dropped into pipelines - we have some cool ones in the pipleine ;) but I we are keen to hear what our users find useful.  

##Whats next

The functionality is mostly working now but we are wanting to let people in slowly, we are running a private beta where a select group of users will be given (free) access. We will then take feedback on what does work and what we missed the mark on. If you think you might be interested in an early access account, [sign up for the beta here](https://beta.laazy.io/beta_signup).
