Seven months ago I started out on my Remote Year adventure, sure I had an itching to see the world, travel to exotic places, meet a big group of crazy, wonderful individuals. That is all true (and accomplished) but my motives however were a little more complex, and I can finally draw the covers back on what I have been working on.

TL;DR; With help from some of my fellow Kaizen's I am launching a private beta for a product I am very excited about. [Go sign up for early free access](https://beta.laazy.io)

##Career crisis or perhaps just midlife

But a little bit of background first. Prior to Remote Year I held a comfortable senior position at one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. I was good at this job and the company remunerated me adequately. The work was interesting but I never truely felt challenged.

Looking back on my career I had always reflexively switched from job to job, leaving one that I didn't like any more, only to pick up the most appealing one presented by recruiters before I started to bemoan the lack of incoming funds. I would stay just longer than was comfortable (usually about 2 years) and then repeat the process.

But that wasn't the biggest problem - and is not an uncommon pattern for developers. The problem was that I was always solving other people's problems, not even my employers problems, but my employers employers problems.

I have [built products and companies for myself in the past](/projects) and despite total success eluding me thus far it has been by far the most interesting and rewarding work I have done.

I wanted to get back to building something of value - it doesn't have to be the next Facebook but if I can solve a problem for a group of people then that is a start.

##The lightening bolt

The problem was that I didn't know what I wanted to build - building a product just for the sake of building something is a terrible idea. It was for this reason that I started this blog in the first place, a project to focus on until lightening struck. Fortunately for me (not so much for this blog) I didn't have to wait long.

Due to an itinerary change - I needed to travel to Serbia for a few days exploring before I was due to finally meeting up with the Kaizen's and start the adventure.

I started this blog a few months prior while adventuring around [New Zealand](/travel/antipodes/). I had managed to keep my publishing fairly regularly, I wanted from the start for posts to be visually engaging, each post had a hero image (top post image), this image needed to be resized into a number of different formats before I could publish the post.

* I needed a full size version, the size for the actual top of the post.
* a tiny thumbnail image for promoting the post on other pages.
* a medium sized version for promoting the post on the blog homepage and twitter.
* then finally I needed a square version cropped and resized for posting on instagram (I know instagram can do this but I prefer not to cede more control over to the social networks).

And that's just for the post header image, there were also the post inline images and homepage header images (which I like to change occasionally).

I am not a designer but I have done a lot of design work in my career, I have a working knowledge of Photoshop and Sketch and whilst these tasks are not difficult by any stretch - they are a waste of time. What made it worse was I stored all the requisite image dimensions in the digital equivalent of a postIT note. There has to be a better way.

With the help of a few of our Kaizen's I am nearly there. I can finally reveal what I have been working on.
