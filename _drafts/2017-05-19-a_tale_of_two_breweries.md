A tale of two breweries

As a part of our Remote Year they organise what they call 'Local tracks', organised activities designed to immerse us in the culture of our current city. They are loosely based around tourist activities but ones that are not so common or as easily accessible.

For example this week we did a walking and eating tour around little Hanoi in the outskirts of Prague (a good primer for when we visit actual Hanoi later on in the year.). We also made an excursion to visit the site of [Lidice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidice), a town the Nazi's physically removed from existence in reprisal for the assignation of [Reinhard Heydrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich) - the highest ranking German officer to be killed during the war.

However, last week it was all about Beer. Czechia is known around the world for it's beer and the place where it all started and still continues to be produced is the town of PzlÃ«n.
