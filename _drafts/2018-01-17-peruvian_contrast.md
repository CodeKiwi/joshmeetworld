By the time I arrived in Lima in December I had been travelling for 11 months. A few hectic preceeding months combined with the [transit from hell](/south_america/2017/12/the_long_way_around) meant I was decidedly burnt out and travel wary, I decided this month was to be about work and not much else.

### Ceviche & Pisco

Peruvian gastronomy and bar culture is as impressive as it is varied but the staples are Ceviche and Pisco, both of which I sampled in abundance, the Ceviehe particularly was standout. Pisco sours were a little full on for my delecate constitution and I'd normally limit myself to one (luckily as they are quite potent).

### Work life balance

After a few hectic months of adventure I had fallen behind on some of my work goals, December was a great month to play catch up. The workspace was great and managed to get back on track with my work. 

Additonally I had been planning a month long adventure with the wonderful [Di McNae](http://willsheeverlaunchherblog.com) starting mid Jan in Lima, working our way east until we reached Bolivia then head south to Chille. This was a great reason not to go on the constant side trips with the Kaizens despite the ever mounting FOMO.

One of the few excursions I did take outside of Lima was a trip down to Punta Hermosa for a Christmas day party, our Remote Year group leaders were nice enough to rent a palacial mansion in one of the many gated communitites that line the beaches south of Lima.

### Second time around

After a few weeks exploring the hedonism that is Colombia at New Years my partner in crime Di joined me in Medellin to start our travels, first up was to head back down to Lima where after a few days we would meet up with our tour group.

We had a few days in Peru before the official start of the tour, with one full free day in Lima we decided to take a Cycle tour of the Miraflores and Baranco regions, I'm embarrassed to say that I learned more in these two hours about Lima and Peru than the entire previous month.
