Due to a change in my Remote Year program, I find myself in Belgrade, Serbia with a full day to kill. My original itinerary was cancelled, but I was offered a far superior (IMO) set of [destinations](/the_plan) starting off in Croatia - also [RemoteYear](http://remoteyear.com/){:target='_blank'} paid for the change in plans so no complaints there. However I had already procured my inbound flights to Belgrade (the previous starting location). I decided to keep my plans and spend a bit of time solo exploring before joining the Remote Year group.

Starting out in Auckland on Thursday afternoon, transiting through Melbourne and Abu Dhabi, 33 hours of travel later I arrived, wary but in one piece in Belgrade. To make the travels worse, for the longest leg of the travel Melb>Abu Dhabi I was seated in an Exit row (yes!) but in front of a six foot five, African lady who refused to let me recline my seat. Commenting that she had long legs and reclining them caused her pain - to which I commented "Yes, me too, that's why I secured extra legroom!" - despite my protests I had to spend the whole 14 hour flight sitting upright.

> I say launched as we travelled at near warp speed down the motorway

I got my first encounter with the Serbian disposition with my airport taxi driver (customs don't count, they are grumpy in every country). After confirming destination and price, I folded myself into his small Alpha-Romeo and he launched off. I say launched as we travelled at near warp speed down the motorway - giving the odd toot of the horn to warn the seemingly stationary traffic that a rocket was approaching - however given our speed, these vehicles probably heard it after we had passed - making the strategy a mere courtesy or a 'fuck you' depending on your perspective.

I started to get the uneasy feeling that I had upset my pilot as he only gave angry looking glances back at me in the mirror. Unwilling to distract him from the task at hand I just decided to hang on. My concerns were somewhat abated when we finally landed at some traffic lights, he reached into the glove box and pulled out a battered tin, opened it and without even moving his head reached back and offered to me "You take lollie?".

Arriving and checking into my adequate but unremarkable hotel, I am surprised that I am not feeling too bad, I venture out to explore my surroundings a little, only walking around the block then park up at into a local beer garden. Gotta stay up. Park at beer garden for dinner.

Following my dinner I hit the wall, barely making it to my hotel room before passing out on the bed fully clothed, waking some unknown number of hours later.

I set out early determined to make the most of my full day exploring the Serbian capital. First stop on my itinerary, the Nikola Tesla museum, a tribute to perhaps one of the most famous Serbians (toss up with Novak Djokovic these days). The museum had working replica's of some of his most important inventions, including a huge Tesla coil generating 2,000,000 volt lightening discharges with a thunderous crack. We were given fluorescent light bulbs and instructed to hold them upright, the bulbs glowed when the lightening cracked without making contact. The Serbian humor finally emerged with our guide noting "Please don't be pointing light rods towards the coil, if the lightening chooses you to discharge, you will be dead".. errm.. OK..

From there I meander through a few parks and towards the main shopping (and smoking it turns out) street - Knez Mihailova St. I decided this to be the perfect place to test out my newest gadget, a 360 degree camera procured on my stopover in Abu Dhabi. I am hoping this combined with my newly acquired selfie stick will be the perfect way to capture and share an entire environment, rather than just a carefully staged or curated photo. I am going to experiment with different ways to use this medium, ideally viewed on a VR headset but can still be viewed on a phone or screen. Give it a go, make sure you expand it and look around.
