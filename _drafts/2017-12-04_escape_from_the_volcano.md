Krabbi and the SS shitshow
Arrive in bali, sense of calm after Asia
Hear rumblings about volcano but don't think anything of it
Kicks off, start to realise this might affect us
Flights start being cancelled, airport closes
Volcano party
Evacuations begin
Sit tight, evacuations continue
Sit tight start to worry, last ones left.
Airport opens, monitoring ash cloud, live YouTube feeds
Flight booked, relax
Day of travel, ash cloud moves again, flights cancelled, ours still on
Haul ass to the airport
Flight delayed but still flying, finnally got boarding passes
Few drinks in the lounge, nervously waiting for the plane to push back.
Only relax once we are finnally in the air
On arrival ages to disembark, broken chip on passport. Announcement that the bags are stuck
