Seven months ago I started out on my Remote Year adventure, sure I had a yearning to see the world, to travel to exotic places and generally do amazing things with a group of crazy, wonderful individuals. That is all true (and accomplished) but my motives however were a little more complex - something I explained a little about in [my very first post](/musings/2017/01/here_we_go), now I am finally ready to draw the covers back on what I have been working on.

> TL;DR; With help from some of my fellow Kaizen's I am launching the private beta for Laazy - a tool for approaching the task of processing images a little differently [Go sign up for early free access](https://beta.laazy.io)

## Career crisis or perhaps just regular midlife one

But a little bit of background first. Prior to RemoteYear I held a comfortable senior position at one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. I was good at this job and the company remunerated me adequately. The work was interesting but I wanted to challenge myself more.

Looking back on my career I had always switched from job to job, leaving one that I didn't like any more, only to pick up the most appealing one presented by recruiters before I started to bemoan the lack of incoming funds. I would stay just longer than was comfortable (usually about 2 years) and then repeat the process.

But that wasn't the biggest problem - and is not an uncommon pattern for developers. The problem was that I was always solving other people's problems, not even my employers problems, but my employers employers problems (clients, eww!).

I have [built products and companies for myself in the past](/projects) despite total success eluding me thus far they have been by far the most interesting and rewarding work I have done.

I wanted to build something of value (not just the billable kind) - it doesn't have to be the next Facebook but if I can solve a problem for a group of people then that is a start and I can expand from there.

## The lightening bolt

The problem was that I didn't know what to build - building a product just for the sake of it is a terrible idea. This is why I started this blog in the first place, partially for writing practice but also a project to focus on until lightening struck. Fortunately for me (not so much for this blog) I didn't have to wait long.

The blog was going well with a fairly regular publishing pace, but from the start I wanted posts to be visually engaging. I was preparing the images for the post on [Serbia](/europe/2017/04/belgrade_in_36_hours) (on my way to join RemoteYear), when the idea came. Each post had a main image resized into a number of different formats and sizes before I could publish the post. Such as simple requirement but this produced a number of images.

* A full size version, the size for the actual top of the post.
* A tiny thumbnail image for promoting the post on other pages.
* A medium sized version for promoting the post on the blog homepage and twitter.
* Finally a square version cropped and resized for posting on instagram (I know instagram can do this but I prefer not to cede more control over to the social networks).

And that's just for the post header image, there were also the post inline images and homepage header images (which I like to change occasionally). Each of these images needed multiple steps to prepare, resizing, cropping (keeping the image focal point centered) along with specific file & folder naming structure, and that's just because I have kept things simple. Suffice to say this seemed like a lot of messing around for a single image.

I am not a designer but I have done a lot of design work in my career, I have a working knowledge of Photoshop and Sketch and whilst these tasks are not difficult by any stretch - I feel they are a waste of time. What made it worse was I stored all the requisite image dimensions in the digital equivalent of a PostIt note - and frequently got one or more of the steps wrong. There has to be a better way.

## The idea

Now I had a problem to solve! The more the problem was researched (read:Googled) and expanded on, the larger the number of possible applications became.

The list of potential users grew from bloggers to include social media power users, website content managers, software developers even photographers, designers and project managers (and much more that I won't reveal just yet). Pretty much anyone who ever has to prepare images for use in a distribution medium (online or otherwise).

So the idea for Laazy was born. Our mission is to make the lives of people who deal with media content for love or money, just that little bit better. Be smart-laazy.

## Whats next

Most creative tools available today focus on what we call the 'canvas' model, which is important when creating original works - but is less useful when consistency and repeatable processing is required. Laazy differs because we focus on repeatable processes rather than the individual image.

The functionality is mostly working now but we are wanting to let people in slowly, we are running a private beta where a select group of users will be given (free) access. We will then take feedback on what does work and what we missed the mark on.

So without going into too much technical detail (thanks Nat), [go check out Laazy](https://beta.laazy.io).
