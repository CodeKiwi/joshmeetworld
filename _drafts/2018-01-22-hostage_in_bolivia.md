The day started in earlier than usual at 3:15am after arriving in Uyuni the previous night. There were vague excuses given about possible road closures.

Once on the road our driver tells us there are protests about living conditions in the city and they are setting up roadblocks to disrupt. He explains that we'll take a back road and should be fine. 

We traverse some off-road terrain for five minues and rejoin the main road - success! Or so we thought. Clear of imminent danger we hit the highway and overtake a white highlux that had been in front of us.

Given it's 4am we are surprised  by the throngs of people walking towards the town to join the days protests in central Uyuni.

We come up to a train overpass and hit some backed up traffic. We realise too late this is a second roadblock. Our drivers quickly uturn and try get out. To our surprise we see the Hilux from earlier manuvering to block the exit. They must have spotted us trying to skip town and had followed us.

Two of our three vehicles were now trapped. The third saw what was happening and reversed before being blocked in but was pursued by an angry mob throwing rocks.

Our driver gets out and confronts the rock armed mob to negotiate, the effort albeit ballsy, yeilds no fruit. We are informed that 'today we are unlucky' and we will be here for 24hrs. By 'here' it was six of us in the seven seat car with luggage. When we ask if this is a dangerous situation our guide tells us they have rocks it's best to remain in the vehicle.

Two incredibly uncomfortable hours pass with little to no information or progress. Topics are raised ranging from 'where will we go to the bathroom' to 'are we actually hostages or just unwanted accessories to their roadblock'. Dawn breaks and we can see our captors who appear pretty disinterested in us. 

The crowds eb and flow, at one quiet point our guides appear to be planning a break for it but think better of it. We ask our driver who drops in on us occasionally if we can leave the car but he says no but there is a plan in the works.

After three hours we are told we are getting out and walking but we must do it quickly - I assume before the throngs figure out they are losing some leverage. We take our large luggage off the roof racks and trundle past the front of the roadblock - the 'guard' at the front gives me a nasty smirk as I walk past which I refuse to acknowledge.

We walk one km with our full luggage packs out of the blockade to awaiting vehicles. We load up and depart but the second car is delayed due to a missing driver. The blockade masses finnally figure out what is happening and begin running towards them shouting in Spanish, the driver emerges running towards the vehicle instructing what was assumed to be 'get in the fkin car'. They manage to peel off and join us a few km down the road where we have stopped.

In saftey we can reflect and joke about what just happened. We turn around and see our two original vehicles coming overland from the desert? As it turns out we were just a distraction to allow the guides to run the blockade via the desert (these are full 4WD's. The guides decided it was too  risky with a car load of Gringo's.

After redistributing the luggage we head back to town. A few km out of town we veer off road into the desert and take a very back streets way into town. It Dawn's on me that the protests are in the town.
