Next stop in my New Zealand tour is to spend a week up in the Coromandel with my Mum, Sister and Brother in law. Sister and her husband drove up in their car whilst I drove Mum and me up through the middle of New Zealand. All up it's a nine hour drive so we decided to spend the night in Rotorua to break up the journey.

Rotorua is a town that primarily exists to service the tourists that make the well travelled path down from Auckland then back again. The town, like Taupo seems like a non-stop procession of hotels and tourist activities. We arrived late and were leaving in the morning so didn't partake in any of these
