This is where my journey begins, in the coldest summer Wellington has had in 30 years or so I'm told. Wellington is known for its crappy weather however this year it seems it has gone to extraordinary lengths to ruin BBQ's for everyone.

I landed in country on the Thursday, the first weekend was the wedding of my good friends Emma and Nick at the wonderful [BoomRock](http://www.boomrock.co.nz/). The weather gods decided to smile on us that one day with absolutly stunning weather combined with with jaw dropping views of the Kapiti coast (I'll be back here in a few weeks) it was a really special day - Check out this amazing photo of the newlyweds with the South Island looming large in the background (those who know Wellington will know this is anything but a given).

So two weeks in Wellington, the goal is to set myself up for the month amongst other things this means buying a car!

Also to practice the practice of remote working - more on that later.
