My travel plans for the upcoming year are [well documented](/the_plan/), not so much my reasons pushing me towards it - I have been intentionally vague when queried on what I am actually doing.

It is true that my cryptic response is due in part to my plans not being entirely set in stone (aka make it up as you go) - primarily, it's because I want engagement from people, not simply passing interest. I want to build a core group of loyal supporters and eventually fans, a group I can draw on to test ideas, garner feedback (and criticism) - who will help celebrate my successes and commiserate my [inevitable failures](http://yesdrillsergeant.com).

I want my journey to be opt-in, first shared to those truly interested, not simply me shouting into my social channels as some sort of [humblebrag](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/16/the-rise-of-humblebragging-the-best-way-to-lose-your-friends-respect/?utm_term=.2af2fedbf89e).

### The curse of Frictionless Engagement

Facebook & LinkedIn are great tools for communicating and connecting people but terrible for engagement. In my opinion a 'like' is akin to a raised eyebrow. Whereas most comments are the social equivalent of "Oh, yep" in response to a conversation. I am aware I may not garner terribly many of either for this particular post. I love getting likes and comments as much as the next guy, but I want to turn this basic engagement into a meaningful dialog.

There is an exception to this though, linking-to, reposting or sharing someones post on ones own channels. Unlike a 1-1 exchange between author and reader it is a public endorsement of the authors point of view and vastly increases the potential eyeballs - furthermore someone sharing someone else's work carries more authority than someones own self-promotion. This is always meaningful and always appreciated ([wink](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={{site.url}}{{ page.url }})).

So with this in mind, I won't be posting to Facebook or LinkedIn quite so much moving forward. Save for the occasional post to remind those who might be lagging behind that I am still around.

My primary medium will be this site and a group I am calling the 'Super-yacht guest list'. For now just a mailing list but I hope to build a community around it.

### Reserve your spot

For now all you need to do is hand over that most precious digital possession, _your email address_ and along with it tacit agreement I can count on you when the time comes.

I will engage with people individually, in groups and with the group as a whole - for any number of things, ranging from but not limited to, you may be asked to;

* Check out a new post I'm particularly proud of
* Participate in market research for an upcoming project or hair-brained scheme
* Review a book chapter or particularly long post
* Test out a new product
* Assist in promoting a new project
* Help me form a government (you may have noticed the quiet rebranding of this site)

### All are welcome on the Super-yacht,<br />but it is crew only, no passengers.

It goes without saying, I won't be sleazy with your details or injudicious with your attention. Seldom more than a single monthly communication. For those that feel this is a little _too engaged_ can still track my progress from the safe distance of Instagram or Twitter.
