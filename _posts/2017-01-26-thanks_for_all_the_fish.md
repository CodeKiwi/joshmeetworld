I am embarking on a journey into places unknown, to travel with people I have never met, to do work that I have not secured for clients and projects that, at this stage don't exist.

I should be worried, but I'm not.

And so it begins, what I so flippantly call my “mid life crisis”, my attempt to find meaning and purpose - to reignite the passion I have for the work that I do. That all sounds a bit dramatic but I have had a feeling growing for some time regarding my career basically “You don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here”. The last 8 years have been spent working at various levels in the creative and digital agency space.

Am I excited?

I want to write, so I will do it here, my work is technical but this project won't cover that, nor will it cover my political leanings or what I ate last night (well perhaps). It will be a record of my travels but I stop short of calling it a travel blog. It is simply my perspective and experience during an interesting period.

I hope you join me.
